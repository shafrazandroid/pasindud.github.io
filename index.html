  <p>This is suddenly came up with when my friends were on a quest to share thee movies and tv shows they have. 
I may have only taken me 1 hours to devlope but took some time desiging
Share it is a online movie / tv series sharing site. In context you may guess that when I say online sharing site you may think it is uploading videos but it is not.
When you share it you share the name, season you got which you have downloaded, brought or stolen from someone. </p>

<p>You may think so what is the use of sharing if you can&#39;t download
it or watched. So if that is the question, I can ask you Why bother downloading and spend your bandwidth [ those days slt usage limit was no limit but now you have ]
when you can ask your friend for the video either telling him to bring it on a pen drive or got to his home. </p>

<p>The site will show a list of video your friend you can select what you.
No longer do you have to worry about downloading a camera copy of a movie and next day find tou that you best friend has a HD copy of the same thing.</p>

  <p>Currenly I am devoloping a online snippet safe form where you can type code online or maybe copy and save it online, the code editor is online is 
fullscreen therefore there is distractions.I be using the laravel framework to do this project which is a really great framework and the Eloquent ORM with 
it&#39;s relationship functionalities makes life easy to the programmers to work with.</p>

  <h3 class="title"><a href="/start-blogging">Start Blogging</a> <span class="date">2012-12-25</span></h3>

  <p>I been looking for a good blogging platform for a time now which is light wight with all options need and hopefully without any database attachted to.</p>

<p>Present blogging platforms like wordpress, druple and others are very capable and extensive they are also a bit of a pine to maintain
due to database and the large code base. Jekyll is a great blogging system after it uses a templaing system markdown so you don&#39;t have to type those tidious 
html tags no longer. Jekyll also powers github pages and many other sites.</p>

<p>Duing this search i also found ruhoh which is also really great the slight best things is that it has a good cmd and help cmd when considering with jekyll i think which has non. You can also create post on using the cmd. I knew ruby coding was bit crazy &quot; one function can be done in many ways &quot; online when I looked at the gem file I found it out.
For instance to find the lenght of the array you can do lenght , size or count. Apart from that understand the code than php which i really have worked with. I did a bit of a hacking to the ruhoh and customized the CLI , added some things to the help yml to include posts list, post count and some otheres, I also added some parameters to be passed when creating new posts.</p>

<p>There was a issuse on ruhoh to get the posts count I fixed it also, don&#39;t really know how good the code is but end of the day it works. I am still bit trying to deploy ruhoh on heroku
hopefully there will be some good documentation in the future</p>
