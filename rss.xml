      <title>Fun With Facebook Api</title>
      <link>http://pasindu.us/experiment/ruhoh/fun-with-facebook-api</link>
      <pubDate>2012-12-29</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had previously used the facebook api for general purpose but not like what I did today. I wanted to compile a statitscs on group members. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="toc_0"&gt;I wanted to calculate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much the member liked - eg - [ I like your post  ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much the users post was like -   [ You like my post  ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much messages the user posted on the group - [ Me posting a new message on the group ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much comments did the member post - [ Me  commenting on your post ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much members posted comments on the users post - [ You  commenting on my post ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much pictures have you posted to the group -[ Me posting a picture to the group ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the start I it was bit trick parsing the JSON file with multiple titles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used facebook&amp;#39;s graph API to do this, to get group post you must give the app access to your group permission , if you give it, it is fair to say the app knows what 
ever you or any of the members of the group dose, and it takes only one person to let it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_1"&gt;It has access  -&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you post on the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What other members post on the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comments you post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comments other members post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pictures you post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pictures others post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your likes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other members likes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id="toc_2"&gt;And Many Many More !!! It knows what ever you do better than you.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  First I got the member list of the group and stored easy nop !&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Then got all pictures posted on the group and there links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then messages posted on the group which is fairly easy to parase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then you have comments that is the not so easy !!
It has many level of parasing , first you have the message you post on and the who posted it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how I parased it , this gives the name of the who posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    [&amp;#39;feed&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;data&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;ori_message&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;comments&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;data&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;comment&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;from&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;name&amp;#39;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the php source to parase it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;     if(array_key_exists(&amp;#39;comments&amp;#39;, $data)==false)
     {
        // This display the comment ID which was deleted by the user
        // It is just a reference there is no messae there.

        echo &amp;quot; Error comments &amp;quot;.$post_id.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;.$data[&amp;#39;updated_time&amp;#39;];

    }
    else
    {
                $comment_wrapper2=$data[&amp;#39;comments&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;data&amp;#39;];

                    foreach ($comment_wrapper2 as $data2) {

                                $user=$data2[&amp;#39;from&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;name&amp;#39;];
                                $user_id=$data2[&amp;#39;from&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;id&amp;#39;];

                                $created_time=$data2[&amp;#39;created_time&amp;#39;];
                                $like_count= $data2[&amp;#39;like_count&amp;#39;];
                                $message= $data2[&amp;#39;message&amp;#39;];
                                $com_id= $data2[&amp;#39;id&amp;#39;];

                    }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to many complication I did not get the details on who liked your comment ( may be there is someone who always like your comment will never know still )
if i implemented that also them json would look something like this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    [&amp;#39;feed&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;data&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;ori_message&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;comments&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;data&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;comment&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;from&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;name&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;data&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;like&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;from&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;name&amp;#39;] 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that was over I had to fetch data and count them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everythings there was easy except comments because when your counting the number of comments for example comments on my post, you cannot add the number of comments 
I post on my comment. Query that data is bit hard to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am trying to built it so that any one can get access to that data and view the stats and may be make there own stats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Share It</title>
      <link>http://pasindu.us/experiment/ruhoh/share-it</link>
      <pubDate>2012-12-27</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is suddenly came up with when my friends were on a quest to share thee movies and tv shows they have. 
I may have only taken me 1 hours to devlope but took some time desiging
Share it is a online movie / tv series sharing site. In context you may guess that when I say online sharing site you may think it is uploading videos but it is not.
When you share it you share the name, season you got which you have downloaded, brought or stolen from someone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may think so what is the use of sharing if you can&amp;#39;t download
it or watched. So if that is the question, I can ask you Why bother downloading and spend your bandwidth [ those days slt usage limit was no limit but now you have ]
when you can ask your friend for the video either telling him to bring it on a pen drive or got to his home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site will show a list of video your friend you can select what you.
No longer do you have to worry about downloading a camera copy of a movie and next day find tou that you best friend has a HD copy of the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share it url : &lt;a href="http://pasindu.us/mov"&gt;http://pasindu.us/mov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and share want you got [ you will may be able to get a couple of bugs while sharing ]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Online Snippets</title>
      <link>http://pasindu.us/experiment/ruhoh/online-snippets</link>
      <pubDate>2012-12-25</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Currenly I am devoloping a online snippet safe form where you can type code online or maybe copy and save it online, the code editor is online is 
fullscreen therefore there is distractions.I be using the laravel framework to do this project which is a really great framework and the Eloquent ORM with 
it&amp;#39;s relationship functionalities makes life easy to the programmers to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_0"&gt;Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Login&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Profile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Public Codes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Private Codes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Online Code Editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Quick save without needing to login&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope fully I will be getting a chance to learn laravel more and more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Start Blogging</title>
      <link>http://pasindu.us/experiment/ruhoh/start-blogging</link>
      <pubDate>2012-12-25</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I been looking for a good blogging platform for a time now which is light wight with all options need and hopefully without any database attachted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Present blogging platforms like wordpress, druple and others are very capable and extensive they are also a bit of a pine to maintain
due to database and the large code base. Jekyll is a great blogging system after it uses a templaing system markdown so you don&amp;#39;t have to type those tidious 
html tags no longer. Jekyll also powers github pages and many other sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duing this search i also found ruhoh which is also really great the slight best things is that it has a good cmd and help cmd when considering with jekyll i think which has non. You can also create post on using the cmd. I knew ruby coding was bit crazy &amp;quot; one function can be done in many ways &amp;quot; online when I looked at the gem file I found it out.
For instance to find the lenght of the array you can do lenght , size or count. Apart from that understand the code than php which i really have worked with. I did a bit of a hacking to the ruhoh and customized the CLI , added some things to the help yml to include posts list, post count and some otheres, I also added some parameters to be passed when creating new posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a issuse on ruhoh to get the posts count I fixed it also, don&amp;#39;t really know how good the code is but end of the day it works. I am still bit trying to deploy ruhoh on heroku
hopefully there will be some good documentation in the future&lt;/p&gt;
